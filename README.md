### Starter kit for whipping up a SCSS/VanillaJS project

Please feel free to utilize this yourself if you find it useful.  
I'm still working on a few things such as elaborate instructions and the following:

I am going to be expanding on the JS architecture soon and may decide to incorporate a PHP framework ([CodeIgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/) or [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)) to bring the starter kit full circle for PHP projects.

### Instructions
1. Fork & Clone repo to your local environment.
2. If you have an apache environment, set up your vhost to look at the public directory.
3. Run **npm i** or **npm install** to install all the needed dependencies.
4. Run **gulp build** to verify the build task is running without errors.
5. Remove/Update the .git Directory to the appropriate repo for your new project.
6. Get started setting up your SCSS variables and get to coding!
