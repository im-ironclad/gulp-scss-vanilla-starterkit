### Starter kit for whipping up a SCSS/VanillaJS project

Please feel free to utilize this yourself if you find it useful.

I am going to be expanding on the JS architecture soon and may decide to incorporate a PHP framework ([CodeIgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/) or [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)) to bring the boilerplate full circle for PHP projects.

### Instructions
1. Clone repo to your local environment.
2. If you have an apache environment, set up your vhost to look at the public directory.
3. Run "**npm i**" or "**npm install**" to install all the needed dependencies.
4. Run "**gulp build**" to verify the build task is running without errors.
5. Remove/Update the .git Directory to the appropriate repo for your new project.
6. Get started setting up your SCSS variables and get to coding!
