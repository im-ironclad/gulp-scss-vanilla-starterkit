### Starter kit for whipping up a SCSS/VanillaJS project
This is my personl in-progress version of a php/scss/vanillajs project.  
Please feel free to utilize this yourself if you find it useful.

I am going to be expanding on the JS architecture soon and may decide to incorporate a PHP framework (CodeIgniter or Laravel) to bring the boilerplate full circle for PHP projects.

### Instructions
1. Clone repo to your local server, or wherever you will be keeping it.
2. If you have an apache environment, set up your vhost to look at the public directory.
3. Run "npm i" or "npm install" to install all the needed dependencies.
4. Run "gulp build" to verify the build task is running without errors.
5. Remove/Update the .git Directory to the appropriate repo for your new project.
6. Get started setting up your SCSS variables and get to coding!
